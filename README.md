# Dream story

This project was a product of Challenge 2 in the Apple Academy. The main purpose of this project was to incorporate the basics of coding (Booleans, Conditionals, ie.) into SwiftUi, specifically app design. Using these two concepts, we were able to develop an app that tells the story we were trying of Tasha, a young and wealthy woman who faces the conumdrum of a leach. \Kinda conrny ngl
